## @maizzle/tailwindcss

**WIP, not published yet - please check back later.**

This package exports a **Tailwind CSS v4 configuration** file that can be used to make the CSS output more email client-friendly. The output will still contain modern CSS syntax, so it needs lowering with a tool like Lightning CSS.

Install it:

```bash
npm install @maizzle/tailwindcss
```

Then, in your CSS:

```css
@import '@maizzle/tailwindcss';
```
